So, i have been pondering over this personal blog over a while now. As a data scientist with a deep love for technology, history and geopolitics, I’ve decided to create a space where I can share my thoughts, insights, and discoveries.

I am a data scientist with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. I started my career as an Automation/ controls enginner with lots of PLC programming and less Python. Later the love for machines and the idea of condition monitoring &  predictive maintenance diverted my carrer towards the data science path -This blog is a culmination of my experiences, learnings, and ongoing exploration of the tech world.

## Blog Themes
Here’s what you can expect:
