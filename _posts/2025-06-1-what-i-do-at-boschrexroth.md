Over the past four years at Bosch Rexroth, I’ve discovered that being a data scientist is about much more than just building models or crunching numbers. Inspired by a recent [blog post](https://medium.com/@nirmal.budhathoki/how-data-science-roles-vary-across-the-tech-companies-cef1893a56a5) on the diversity of data science roles, I took some time to reflect on how my own journey has evolved—and how it stands apart from the “pure tech” roles often described online.

At Bosch Rexroth, my day-to-day work is a unique blend of technology, strategy, project management, and mentorship. I’m not only developing technical solutions, but also shaping project direction, aligning with stakeholders, and guiding others. This cross-disciplinary approach makes my role dynamic, challenging, and deeply rewarding. In this post, I’ll share what I do as a data scientist in Data & AI Solutions, and why this mix of responsibilities keeps me excited every day.

## Building and Maintaining Industrial AI Pipelines

I develop and maintain analysis pipelines that deliver real-time insights from machine data. My responsibilities include:

- Building deep learning models for anomaly detection.
- Creating analytics to monitor hydraulic components.
- Ensuring reliable operations in our AWS environment.

I deploy scalable FastAPI services, write production-ready Python code, and focus on predictive maintenance solutions. I also explore time series analysis and develop new models to enhance our offerings.

## Use Case Analysis & PoC Development

A significant part of my role is identifying impactful use cases and developing proof-of-concepts (PoCs) that can become full products. I collaborate with teams across sales, logistics, manufacturing, and engineering to address real-world challenges.

Some PoCs I’ve worked on:

- **Centralized Parameter Storage & Analysis:** Built a system in Azure Cloud (using Azure Functions, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, and Streamlit) to collect and analyze parameters from hydraulic components.
- **RAG Pipeline for Smart:** Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Unstructured and Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract diagnostic information from thousands of technical documents, aiding in hydraulic system troubleshooting.

This work requires strategic thinking, problem-solving, product mindset, stakeholder alignment, and engineering execution.

## Research & Mentorship

I also supervise master’s theses and research internships in partnership with universities, focusing on applied industrial AI. Topics I’ve guided include:

* Forecasting key parameters in hydraulic components to predict failures.
* Detecting data drift in production models.
* Edge AI for on-device anomaly detection.
* Agentic AI systems for holistic sensor data analysis.

In these projects, I act as both mentor and research lead, ensuring academic rigor and real-world relevance.

What excites me most about my work is the constant learning and impact. I love the challenge, and it’s what makes me jump out of bed every day. Being a data scientist in Data & AI Solutions at Bosch Rexroth is much more than building models; it’s a dynamic, cross-disciplinary role that’s always evolving.
