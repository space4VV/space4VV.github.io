Over the past four years at Bosch Rexroth, I’ve grown as a data scientist, blending technology, strategy, and mentorship in my daily work. Inspired by a recent [blog post](https://medium.com/@nirmal.budhathoki/how-data-science-roles-vary-across-the-tech-companies-cef1893a56a5), I reflected on my journey and how my role has evolved.

## Building and Maintaining Industrial AI Pipelines

I develop and maintain analysis pipelines that deliver real-time insights from machine data. My responsibilities include:

- Building deep learning models for anomaly detection.
- Creating analytics to monitor hydraulic components.
- Ensuring reliable operations in our AWS environment.

I deploy scalable FastAPI services, write production-ready Python code, and focus on predictive maintenance solutions. I also explore time series analysis and develop new models to enhance our offerings.

## Use Case Analysis & PoC Development

A significant part of my role is identifying impactful use cases and developing proof-of-concepts (PoCs) that can become full products. I collaborate with teams across sales, logistics, manufacturing, and engineering to address real-world challenges.

Some PoCs I’ve worked on:

- **Centralized Parameter Storage & Analysis:** Built a system in Azure Cloud (using Azure Functions, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, and Streamlit) to collect and analyze parameters from hydraulic components.
- **RAG Pipeline for Smart:** Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Unstructured and Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract diagnostic information from thousands of technical documents, aiding in hydraulic system troubleshooting.

This work requires strategic thinking, problem-solving, product mindset, stakeholder alignment, and engineering execution.

## Research & Mentorship

I also supervise master’s theses and research internships in partnership with universities, focusing on applied industrial AI. Topics I’ve guided include:

* Forecasting key parameters in hydraulic components to predict failures.
* Detecting data drift in production models.
* Edge AI for on-device anomaly detection.
* Agentic AI systems for holistic sensor data analysis.

In these projects, I act as both mentor and research lead, ensuring academic rigor and real-world relevance.

Being a data scientist in Data & AI Solutions at Bosch Rexroth means much more than building models— it’s a dynamic, cross-disciplinary role that’s always evolving.
